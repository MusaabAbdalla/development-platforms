## Introduction

Railway is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that enhances software development by enabling quick deployment and easy scaling of applications. The platform incorporates integrated tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), which help developers set up their infrastructure, develop locally, and then deploy efficiently to the cloud. This integration simplifies the entire development workflow.Additionally, Railway supports a diverse range of programming languages such as Java, PHP, Python, Swift, and Go, allowing for rapid deployment of applications to the cloud in just minutes.

## Brief History

Railway.app, founded in 2020 by Jake Cooper, is designed to simplify application deployments and infrastructure management for developers. It offers a user-friendly platform that competes with platform as as service (Paas) like Heroku by focusing on accessibility and ease of management.
