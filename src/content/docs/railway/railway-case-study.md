## Introduction

Railway is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that enhances software development by enabling quick deployment and easy scaling of applications. The platform incorporates integrated tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), which help developers set up their infrastructure, develop locally, and then deploy efficiently to the cloud. This integration simplifies the entire development workflow.
