## Introduction

Railway is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that enhances software development by enabling quick deployment and easy scaling of applications. The platform incorporates integrated tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), which help developers set up their infrastructure, develop locally, and then deploy efficiently to the cloud. This integration simplifies the entire development workflow.Additionally, Railway supports a diverse range of programming languages such as Java, PHP, Python, Swift, and Go, allowing for rapid deployment of applications to the cloud in just minutes.

## Brief History

Railway.app, founded in 2020 by Jake Cooper, is designed to simplify application deployments and infrastructure management for developers. It offers a user-friendly platform that competes with platform as as service (Paas) like Heroku by focusing on accessibility and ease of management.

| **Quick Deployment**                             |  Railway.app allows users to deploy their applications quickly and easily by connecting directly to the deployment source, such as GitHub. The platform automatically generates an OCI compliant image based on the source code from the deployment source. Additionally, users can use Docker images directly from Docker Hub or the GitHub Container Registry. This streamlined process ensures that applications are deployed swiftly and efficiently without any complicated setup or configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Scalability**                                  | Railway.app supports both vertical and horizontal Scaling: Vertical Scaling: Railway. app provides an automated scaling feature that increases CPU and RAM as your application's workload grows, ensuring smooth performance without manual adjustments.  Horizontal Scaling: Add more machines to your setup, distributing the workload to maintain performance under heavy load. This helps keep your application running efficiently during peak usage times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **CI/CD Integration**                            | CI/CD, or Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, is a way of automating the process of building, testing, and deploying software each time a code change occurs. This enables the developers to deliver software more efficiently and frequently. We use GitLab CI/CD to automate our deployments on Railway.app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
